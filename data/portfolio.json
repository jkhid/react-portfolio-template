I'm a recent graduate with a BS in Computer Science and a great interest in data science, analytics, and engineering. My professional ambition is to work on hands-on data projects, applying my professional and academic knowledge to practical challenges. I am also gearing up to start an online Master's program in Computer Science, aiming to expand my knowledge in the field and contribute significantly to future workplaces. Outside of my tech-centric world, I find relaxation in reading, golf, basketball, and doing outdoor activities. Recently, I've also taken up chess; although I'm not good (yet), I'm thoroughly enjoying the learning process. These activities not only provide relaxation and pleasure but are pivotal in my ongoing journey of learning and self-improvement.","resume":{"tagline":"ðŸ‘‹ I'm a recent Computer Science graduate eager to leverage my skills to make data-driven insights","description":"","experiences":[{"id":"1","dates":"June 2023 - September 2023","type":"Internship","position":"Software Portfolio Management Intern","bullets":" Achieved a 20% reduction in redundant applications and contributing to cost efficiency and system simplicity, Developed and maintained accurate data models for the university's application portfolio, Systematically collected and organized data relating to various software applications, Collaborated with a broad range of stakeholders to accurately identify and assess application requirements and needs"},{"id":"d495c23b-4f65-479a-9b8a-cfbc1c089725","dates":"","type":"","position":"","bullets":""}],"education":{"universityName":"Western Governors University","universityDate":"2024","universityPara":"Relevant Coursework: Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Web Development, Introduction to AI, Advanced Data Management, Network and Security"},"languages":["Python","SQL","Java","JavaScript"],"frameworks":["NodeJs","React"],"others":["Excel","Power BI","Tableau"]}}
